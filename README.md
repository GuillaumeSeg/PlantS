HOW TO INSTALL THE PROJECT :

If you read this document, you should have downloaded the project via GIT.

To make it works, you need the following library :
	> jogl-2.0
	> jdom-2.0.3

	> For jogl-2.0 :
	libjogl/jogamp-all-platforms/jar/gluegen-rt.jar
	libjogl/jogamp-all-platforms/jar/jogl-all.jar
	
	> For jdom-2.0.3
	jdom-2.0.3/jdom-2.0.3.jar

To finish, you have to link these JARS to the corresponding library.
All library (.so files) are available in "lib/" folders :

	> For jogl-2.0 :
	libjogl/jogamp-all-platforms/lib/
	
	> For jdom-2.0.3 :
